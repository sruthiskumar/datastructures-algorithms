## Linked List
- Linked List is an implementation of List data structure
- Each element is linked to/reference its next element
- In a *singly linked list* we have forward refernce where each element has a reference to its next element
- Linked List is accessed via the very first element in the list called *Head*
- Last element in a Linked List points to null
- Each element in a linked list has a data/element and a pointer/reference to the next element (i.e, A single node in a linked list consists of data and a reference as in the below diagram)
