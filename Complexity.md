Complexity is the measure of performance. Performance is measured on resource consumption and in real world code can consume multiple resources. 
Complexity is also a measure on how resource requirements change as size of the problem increases(Example: larger inputs). Higher the complexity of the problem, lower the performance. 

``Performance improvement might involve tradoffs``

### Important Measures of Performance
- Time (Number of operations/ Amount of processing)
- Space (Memory to store run time information and the disk space for persistent storage)
- Network (Bandwidth used by different machines/clients)
